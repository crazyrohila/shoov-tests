# shoov-tests

Simple test example to demo:
1. How to create different folders for different test bundles
2. How to move from one page to another and take screenshot
3. Fill out form (login) and then take screenshot

For this I had to tweak shoov-cssdriver wrapper, so added that in package.json.

So put these files shoov generator `visual-monitor` folder and run npm install again. and then run tests.
